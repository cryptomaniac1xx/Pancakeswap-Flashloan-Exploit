# PancakeSwap-Token-Sniper

## How to use it:
1. Deploy contract using http://remix.ethereum.org/ on Binance Smart Chain
2. Send some BNB to contract to take a loan (more you send , bigger loan you can take)
3. Call function 'Action' to start.

## How it works:
There is a small loophole in pancakeswap flash loan contract
First it take a loan with bnb on contract , then it swaps it around to farm liquidity pools change amd them repays loan in same transaction while keeping profits. For most of a times its around 10 to 20 % of profits , so if you start with 1 BNB after one round you should have from 1.1 to 1.2 BNB , not much but you can do it over and over again. Use it while it still works!
